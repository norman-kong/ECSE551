# Machine Learning Models

These projects were completed for the course ECSE 551 (Machine Learning for Engineers) at McGill University (W2023). 

MP1: Linear Classifiers - Logistic Regression
- Performed standard statistical analyses on 2 datasets.
- Implemented logistic regression (from scratch, in Python) to classify the data.
- Analyzed and discussed its performance and the significance of the results. Our model gave a test accuracy of 74.8% and 70% on the datasets, respectively.
- Datasets:
  - kidney dataset: class 0 vs class 1 based on person attributes like glucose levels, heart rate, etc.
  - wine dataset: low vs. high quality based on wine attributes like hue, alcohol content, etc.
- Submitted in collaboration with Yinuo Li and Yicheng Yuan.
  
MP2: Naive Bayes Model with K-Fold Cross Validation 
- Preprocessed text data for machine learning experiments (tokenization of text, conversion to word vectors, etc.). 
- Implemented the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model (from scratch) to classify text data.
- Analyzed and discussed its performance and the significance of the results. The model achieved a score of 95.18% and 91.3% on a preliminary test set and the official test set of an academic Kaggle competition (placing 12th, the highest from a submission by a single individual), respectively. 
- Dataset: text originated from reddit, classified into its originating subreddit (where it came from).
