These projects were completed for the course ECSE 551 (Machine Learning for Engineers) at McGill University (W2023). 

MP1: Linear Classifiers
- Implemented logistic regression in Python to classify a kidney dataset (class 0 vs class 1 based on person attributes like glucose levels, heart rate, etc.) and a wine dataset (low vs. high quality based on wine attributes like hue, alcohol content, etc.). Our model gave a test accuracy of 74.8% and 70% on the datasets, respectively.
